## Data Structures and Algorithms - Theory and Practice

This repository is a work in progress containing JavaSript/C++ code for some of the most used data structures and algorithms as I learn and code them. Also, it contains solutions for some common interview problems from programming challenges platforms like Hackerrank, Leetcode and Codewars that I will be solving along the way.

Please, keep in mind that, as I am also a student, the code may not (probably not) be the most efficient and readable, so if you have suggestions of improvements or corrections please feel free to reach out and contribute.
