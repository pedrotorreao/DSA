## Topological Sort

### Definition

A topological sort is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where for each directed edge from `node A` to `node B`, `node A` appears before `node B` in the ordering. The topological sort algorithm is able to find a topological order in O(V+E) time. Also, there may be multiple possible solutions.

It is important to mention that in order to be able to perform a topological sort in a graph, the graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

- Example:

`... insert image here`
