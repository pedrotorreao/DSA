## Greedy Algorithms

### Definition

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. It is worth mentioning, however, that this approach may not return the overall best result - global optimum, it will pick the best option at each step (hence the greedy name) hoping that it might lead to the best result, but it might end up with a solution that is a local optimum.

For the cases in which a greedy based approach leads to the correct result, it will likely be the best approach since it usually tends to be easier to implement and faster.
